## npm + Node.js

Be sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed before proceeding. **We recommend using Node's LTS releases, which is currently at v16.x. We only test our compiled CSS against v16.**

```shell
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-npm-starter
cd bootstrap-npm-starter

# Install dependencies
npm i

# Compile Sass
npm run css-compile

# Start server and watch Sass
npm start

# Watch Sass for changes (uses nodemon)
npm run watch

# Start local server
npm run server

# Watches Sass for changes and starts a local server
npm start
```

For the most straightforward development, open Terminal and run `npm start`.

Open <http://localhost:3000> to see the page in action.
